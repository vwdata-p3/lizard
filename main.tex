\begin{abstract}
This note specifies
``lizard''
a reversible injection from $\{0,\dotsc,255\}^{16}$
to ristretto255, a prime order elliptic curve group built 
    on top of Curve25519.
\end{abstract}

\section{Background}
Curve25519 is a widely adopted elliptic curve
that was originally intended\cite{x25519} for 
Diffie--Hellman key exchange,
but is now also used for
digital signatures\cite{ed25519}
and public key encryption\cite{rfc6637}.
As long as it keeps withstanding attacks and public scrutiny
(as stubbornly as quantum computers resist realisation)
Curve25519 is likely to be the basis for many more popular
cryptographic schemes to come.

From an abstract point of view
Curve25519 provides a cyclic group~$G$
with cheap addition, negation, and scalar multiplication,
but in which less elementary problems, 
such as the computation of discrete logarithms,
remain practically insoluble.
Schemes formulated in terms of~$G$
derive their security primarily from 
the estimated hardness of such problems:
to learn such and such secret,
attackers would
need to solve
this and that problem,
which is currently considered impossible.
While such an abstract view
provides a clean setting 
to formalise schemes
and analyse their security,
an attacker is not bound by it,
and may exploit `implementation details' instead.

Care must be taken,
for example,
in checking that points provided by untrusted parties,
for if these lie outside the curve,
they may lie on a curve of small order,
in which the discrete logarithm problem is tractable
(see~\cite{invalidcurveattack,hmqvattack} for more details.)
The problem here is not that it
is terribly expensive to thwart such 
`invalid-curve attacks'
by checking that points lie on the curve,
but rather that such a check need not be performed on the same point twice,
so that it can easily be omitted once too often by accident
in an implementation of a scheme not concerned with such details.
Bernstein's Curve25519 Diffie--Hellman scheme sidesteps
this issue by using an encoding of points
that never yields points outside the valid curve
by design.

Another matter designers have to contend with
is the existence of points of order~$8$ in~$G$.
During a Diffie--Hellman key exchange, for instance,
such a point can be used by an attacker
(in a `small-subgroup attack')
to learn the three least significant
bits of its correspondent's secret key.
Although the revelation of these three bits has
negligible impact on the security of vanilla Diffie--Hellman,
these low-order bits are nevertheless prudently set to~$0$
(see~``Responsibilities of the user'', \S3 of~\cite{x25519}).
For more complex protocols,
attacks based on small-order points
can be subtler and far more serious.
The designers of CryptoNote\cite{cryptonote},
for example,
had not taken into account\cite{monero-disclosure,monero-curves-post}
that
their `one-time ring signature',
that was supposed to force the spender of a coin
to reveal the `key image' of this coin
(a unique point in~$G$ used to record that the coin was spend),
only forces the spender to reveal
the `key image' \emph{plus} a point of order $\leq 8$,
making it possible to spend the same coin 8~times.
The obvious solution is to restrict
the key images
to the first factor of~$G\cong \Z/\ell\Z \oplus \Z/8\Z$,
so that there is only one possible key image modulo
the small subgroup $\cong \Z/8\Z$.
This restriction can be enforced by checking that the $\ell$-fold
sum of a key image is zero,
which is indeed the way the vulnerability 
was patched in the CryptoNote based 
currency Monero.\cite{monero-fix}
